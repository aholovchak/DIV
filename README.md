## **Methods Overview**  

This repository includes implementations of the following instrumental variable (IV) and distributional regression methods:  

- **Control Functions (CF)** â€“ An IV method developed in econometrics **(Heckman, 1976; Newey, 1999)** for interventional mean estimation. It decomposes the hidden confounder into a treatment-correlated and an independent part. The nonlinear version uses **natural cubic splines** for basis expansion (**Guo, 2016**).  

- **DeepIV** (**Hartford et al., 2017**) â€“ A deep learning-based IV method using neural networks to estimate the conditional density of \(X | Z=z\) in the first stage. It relies on moment restrictions (akin to a deep version of 2SLS) and is limited to interventional mean estimation.

- **DeepGMM** (**Bennett et al., 2020**) â€“ An IV method based on the **generalized method of moments (GMM)**, using neural networks to learn a structural function that satisfies the moment restriction. It estimates interventional means.  
  - ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CausalML/DeepGMM)  

- **HSIC-X** (**Saengkyongam et al., 2022**) â€“ A neural network-based IV approach leveraging the **Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC)** to enforce instrument validity restrictions. Designed for interventional mean estimation.  
  - ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sorawitj/HSIC-X)  

- **DIVE** (**Kook et al., 2024**) â€“ A distributional IV approach utilizing **independence restrictions**, designed for estimating **distributional causal effects** with binary treatment and an absolutely continuous response.  
  - ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LucasKook/dive)  

- **IVQR** (**Chernozhukov & Hansen, 2005**) â€“ An **IV quantile regression** framework for estimating **quantile treatment effects (QTEs)** for binary treatment and absolutely continuous response.  
  - ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yuchang0321/IVQR)  

- **Engression** (**Shen et al., 2024**) â€“ A **generative modeling-based distributional regression** method that minimizes **energy loss** to learn the conditional distribution of \(Y | X = x\). It is **not** an IV method.
